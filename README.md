# WordGuessGame

Developing this game was a challenging and rewarding experience.  While not perfect, I feel that I've been able to use almost everything I've learned so far (with the exception of jQuery, which was intentionally omitted from this project).

Press any keyboard key to begin guessing letters for the game.  The words the game contains are all native Oregon wildlife.  I think with some additional development this could be a fun learning tool for children.
